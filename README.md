## Rules of the game-
This game is played by Computer vs Player.

-  Computer starts by setting a random 4-digit number.
-  Player takes an attempt at guessing the number.
-  If Player succeeds in the first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) 
they win the game and are crowned MASTERMIND! 
-  If not, then Computer hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player got correct. 
(Bonus: The correct positions of the numbers Player got right are also revealed.)
-  The game continues till Player eventually is able to guess the number entirely.
-  At the end of which they are crowned as a true MASTERMIND!
